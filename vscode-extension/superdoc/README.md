# Superdoc 🚀

**Superdoc is an AI documentation co-pilot that reads any technical documentation for you, allowing you to get instant answers and code snippets just by asking questions.**

Stop switching between your editor and browser. With Superdoc, the docs come to you. Ask a question in plain English and get precise, code-rich answers without ever leaving VS Code.

## ✨ Features

*   🔍 **Query Any Documentation Directly:** Provide a URL to any documentation, and Superdoc will read and understand it. Ask complex questions like "How do I set up Google auth?" and get precise answers and code snippets in seconds.

*   🌐 **Discover Docs with AI:** Don't have a link? Just type a name like "Firebase documentation." Superdoc's AI will find the official link for you and suggest specific sub-pages to target exactly what you need.

*   🧩 **Seamless Workflow Integration:** Superdoc is available everywhere you work. Use the VS Code Extension to get answers without ever leaving your editor, or the Browser Extension to query docs directly on the page.

*   🗺️ **Intelligent Site Mapping and Routing:** Superdoc scrapes the entire documentation site to create a "map" of its contents. Its two-step AI first routes your question to the most relevant page before extracting the final answer, ensuring incredible accuracy.

*   🎙️ **Go Hands-Free with Voice Mode:** Ask your questions out loud. Superdoc's Voice Mode allows you to interact with documentation completely hands-free, making it faster and more natural to get information while you code.

Superdoc processes the request, finds the most relevant information from the documentation, and displays a comprehensive answer directly within your VS Code panel.
